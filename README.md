# bookstore


This app allows you to create, update, and delete user profiles (similar to a todo-list app, as the user layer was taken 
from it). You can also manage book items with general CRUD operations. The main difficulty of this app compared to the 
"todo-list" app is the ability to search for books using optional criteria, such as book title, author, genre, and price 
range (from and to).

- Was it easy to complete the task using AI?

  Yes, using ChatGPT made the process more manageable, particularly for generating unit tests and obtaining initial code 
  templates. It provided helpful suggestions and guidance throughout the development.

- How long did the task take you to complete?

  It took me approximately 6 hours to complete this task. This includes both development and integration of the provided 
  code snippets.

- Was the code ready to run after generation? What did you have to change to make it usable?

  The code generated by ChatGPT often required modifications. I had to refactor many parts to ensure they fit the context 
  of my application. For instance, I had to adjust the logic within services and mappers and implement some additional 
  functionalities. While the generated code served as a valuable foundation, it was not ready to run immediately.

- Which challenges did you face during the completion of the task?

  I intentionally did not include logging and security (authentication and authorization) as these were not necessary for 
  this small application. The app includes controller, service, and repository layers and is sufficiently functional for 
  its intended purpose.

- Which specific prompts did you learn as good practice to complete the task?

  Chatting with ChatGPT in its current version (ChatGPT-3), I try to converse with it like with a person, asking it 
  about something, explaining the context of a method or procedure to get the most precise result possible.
